Rampart uses many components and libraries from several sources.  We've strived to
use only software licensed under a permissive licenses such as MIT, BSD or Apache.

A major exception is the RSAL license for the Texis Library and related files used 
by the rampart-sql module. The text of this license may be found at

In general, code written by us is licensed under the MIT License.

Please see the documentation at https://rampart.dev/docs for more information.
Each section has near its beginning a description of the licenses used.

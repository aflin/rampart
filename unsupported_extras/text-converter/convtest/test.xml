    Rampart is a javascript based complete stack development environment
    which is extremely resource stingy. This entire site is running on a
    Raspberry Pi Zero (version 1). Rampart is also fast and portable; it
    will run on nearly any *nix OS and benchmarks nearly as fast as
    Nginx on static content. It's also free to use, modify, and
    redistribute in most use cases.

  We're not kidding about it being resource stingy. Here's the Rampart

    Rampart's HTTP/HTTPS server is based on a modded libevhtp_ws and

    we really respect), so that's why we chose it. We haven't
    benchmarked it against Node yet but it's reasonable to assume we'll
    keep pace while consuming a lot less of the host's resources

    its own isolated JavaScript interpreter and variables are easily
    shared at any time via a clipboard. Running an asynchronous callback
    in a thread when a variable is copied to the clipboard

    LMDB is a fast, truly ACID compliant RAM based key-value store. It's
    read biased and serves binary or text data really well. We've added
    automatic conversion to/from CBOR and JSON to make it that much
    easier. It's not as fast as Redis when in full ACID mode, but then
    again it'll never lose data when Redis might. LMDB startup is
    relatively instant, even on large databases, and it's persistent to
    disk in case of unexpected interruption.

    Why? Python has a gazillion modules and support for many, many
    databases. If you need functionality that Rampart doesn't (yet)
    provide, this can get your there. See

  <title>Why did we do this?</title>
  <para>
    While NodeJS is extremely popular and NPM provides a ton of add-ons
    quickly, on the whole it's pretty fat. By the time you configure
    MariaDB and Apache Lucene you've eaten a day (or more) and a
    considerable amount of resources on the host machine. Additionally,
    it's not that much fun.
  </para>
  <para>
    In creating Rampart we sought to create a &quot;full stack&quot;
    that was simple and fast to download, configure, and start creating
    whatever application you had in mind in a time frame measured in
    minutes rather than days. User machines, phones, and IOT devices
    need to serve their primary role without impediment. Rampart's job
    is to support that role and not get in the way. OTOH if you dedicate
    a machine or cluster to a Rampart task you'll get a lot more done
    with a lot less investment.
  </para>
  <para>
    We chose the DukTape javascript engine over the V8 engine because
    while V8 is very fast, it's also kind of a RAM and CPU pig. Our
    philosophy was to do everything difficult or complex in C and let
    javascript be the fun-glue. That way it really didn't matter what
    engine was chosen. Almost every module is coded in C as is the
    DukTape interpreter. This makes everything extremely portable with a
    minimum amount of fuss. We include the Babel transpiler to drag
    DukTape into ECMAScript 2015+ land. Rampart checks at runtime if
    you've changed anything and then transpiles automatically behind the
    scenes.

  <para>
    Moat Crossing Systems LLC, the makers of Rampart, is a couple of
    guys who between them have developed software and applications that
    have served many billions of pages of database backed content on the
    internet. We had some summer help from a couple of Columbia students
    who helped up keep tabs on the &quot;current-think&quot; and coded
    some of the OS Utility functions. It all started in January of 2020
    with a phone conversation where we were bitching about how un-fun
    web development had become, and how resource heavy everything seemed
    to be. A comment was made that if we could full-text index Wikipedia
    and serve it up on a Raspberry Pi Zero, then we'd have something
    unique that people might want.

    Here's a photo of our fancy server farm before it was installed in a
    rack at the ISP. There's four Pi Zeros and two Pi 4s. The four Zeros
    are mirror copies of one another just in case *stuff* happens. The
    two Pi 4's allow us to do development and builds a bit faster than
    the Zeros allow us. The &quot;bush&quot; is proxied by an NginX
    server running on a fairly large old Xeon machine. This made
    certificate managment and other things somewhat easier on us.

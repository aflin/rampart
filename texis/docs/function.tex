\section{Server functions}
The Texis server has a number of functions built into it which can operate
on fields.  This can occur anywhere an expression can occur in a SQL
statement.  It is possible that the server at your site has been extended
with additional functions.  Each of the arguments can be either a single
field name, or another expression.

\input{funcs-file}
\input{funcs-string}
\input{funcs-math}
\input{funcs-date}
\input{funcs-bit}
\input{funcs-ip}
\input{funcs-geo}
\input{funcs-json}

\subsubsection{exec}

Execute an external command.  The syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
   exec(commandline[, INPUT[, INPUT[, INPUT[, INPUT]]]]);
\end{verbatim}

Allows execution of an external command.  The first argument is the
command to execute.  Any subsequent arguments are written to the standard
input of the process.  The standard output of the command is read as the
return from the function.

This function allows unlimited extensibility of Texis, although if a
particular function is being used often then it should be linked into the
Texis server to avoid the overhead of invoking another process.

For example this could be used to OCR text.  If you have a program which
will take an image filename on the command line, and return the text on
standard out you could issue SQL as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
     UPDATE     DOCUMENTS
     SET        TEXT = exec('ocr '+IMGFILE)
     WHERE      TEXT = '';
\end{verbatim}

Another example would be if you wanted to print envelopes from names and
addresses in a table you might use the following SQL:

\begin{verbatim}
     SELECT	exec('envelope ', FIRST_NAME+' '+LAST_NAME+'
     ', STREET + '
     ', CITY + ', ' + STATE + ' ' + ZIP)
     FROM ADDRESSES;
\end{verbatim}

Notice in this example the addition of spaces and line-breaks between the
fields.  Texis does not add any delimiters between fields or arguments
itself.

\subsubsection{mminfo}

This function lets you obtain Metamorph info.  You have the choice of
either just getting the portions of the document which were the hits, or
you can also get messages which describe each hit and subhits.

The SQL to use is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
    SELECT mminfo(query,data[,nhits,[0,msgs]]) from TABLE
           [where CONDITION];
\end{verbatim}

\begin{description}
\item[query]

Query should be a string containing a metamorph query.

\item[data]

The text to search. May be literal data or a field from the table.

\item[nhits]

The maximum number of hits to return.  If it is 0, which
is the default, you will get all the hits.

\item[msgs]

An integer; controls what information is returned. A bit-wise OR of
any combination of the following values:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 to get matches and offset/length information
\item 2 to suppress text from \verb`data` which matches; printed by default
\item 4 to get a count of hits (up to \verb`nhits`)
\item 8 to get the hit count in a numeric parseable format
\item 16 to get the offset/length in the original query of each search set
\end{itemize}

Set offset/length information (value 16) is of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
Set N offset/len in query: setoff setlen
\end{verbatim}
Where \verb`N` is the set number (starting with 1), \verb`setoff` is
the byte offset from the start of the query where set \verb`N` is,
and \verb`setlen` is the length of the set.
This information is available in version 5.01.1220640000 20080905
and later.

Hit offset/length information is of the form:
\begin{verbatim}
300 <Data from Texis> offset length suboff sublen [suboff sublen]..
301 End of Metamorph hit
\end{verbatim}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item offset is the offset within the data of the overall hit context
      (sentence, paragraph, etc...)
\item length is the length of the overall hit context
\item suboff is the offset within the hit of a matching term
\item sublen is the length of the matching term
\item suboff and sublen will be repeated for as many terms as are
      required to satisfy the query.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}


\begin{verbatim}
Example:
   select mminfo('power struggle @0 w/.',Body,0,0,1) inf from html
          where Title\Meta\Body like 'power struggle';
Would give something of the form:

300 <Data from Texis> 62 5 0 5
power
301 End of Metamorph hit
300 <Data from Texis> 2042 5 0 5
power
301 End of Metamorph hit
300 <Data from Texis> 2331 5 0 5
POWER
301 End of Metamorph hit
300 <Data from Texis> 2892 8 0 8
STRUGGLE
301 End of Metamorph hit
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{convert}
\label{convertSqlFunction}

The convert function allows you to change the type of an expression.
The syntax is
\begin{verbatim}
   CONVERT(expression, 'type-name'[, 'mode'])
\end{verbatim}
The type name should in general be in lower case.

This
can be useful in a number of situations.  Some cases where you might want
to use convert are
\begin{itemize}
\item  The display format for a different format is more useful.  For example
you might want to convert a field of type COUNTER to a DATE field, so you
can see when the record was inserted, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
    SELECT convert(id, 'date')
    FROM   LOG;
\end{verbatim}

\begin{smscreen}
\begin{verbatim}
    CONVERT(id, 'date')
    1995-01-27 22:43:48
\end{verbatim}
\end{smscreen}
\item  If you have an application which is expecting data in a particular
type you can use convert to make sure you will receive the correct type.
\end{itemize}


Caveat: Note that in Texis version 7 and later, \verb`convert()`ing
data from/to \verb`varbyte`/\verb`varchar` no longer converts the data
to/from hexadecimal by default (as was done in earlier versions) in
programs other than \verb`tsql`; it is now preserved as-is (though
truncated at nul for \verb`varchar`).  See the \verb`bintohex()` and
\verb`hextobin()` functions (p.~\pageref{bintohexSqlFunction}) for
hexadecimal conversion, and the \verb`hexifybytes` SQL property
(p.~\pageref{hexifybytesProperty}) for controlling automatic hex
conversion.

Also in Texis version 7 and later, an optional third argument may be
given to \verb`convert()`, which is a \verb`varchartostrlstsep` mode
value (p.~\pageref{`varchartostrlstsep'}).  This third argument may
only be supplied when converting to type \verb`strlst` or
\verb`varstrlst`.  It allows the separator character or mode to be
conveniently specified locally to the conversion, instead of having to
alter the global \verb`varchartostrlstsep` mode.

\subsubsection{seq}

Returns a sequence number.  The number can be initialized to any value,
and the increment can be defined for each call.  The syntax is:

\begin{verbatim}
	seq(increment [, init])
\end{verbatim}

If {\tt init} is given then the sequence number is initialized to that value,
which will be the value returned.  It is then incremented by {\tt increment}.
If {\tt init} is not specified then the current value will be retained.  The
initial value will be zero if {\tt init} has not been specified.

Examples of typical use:

\begin{verbatim}
     SELECT  NAME, seq(1)
     FROM    SYSTABLES
\end{verbatim}

The results are:

\begin{screen}
\begin{verbatim}
  NAME                seq(1)
 SYSTABLES               0
 SYSCOLUMNS              1
 SYSINDEX                2
 SYSUSERS                3
 SYSPERMS                4
 SYSTRIG                 5
 SYSMETAINDEX            6
\end{verbatim}
\end{screen}

\begin{verbatim}
     SELECT  seq(0, 100)
     FROM    SYSDUMMY;

     SELECT  NAME, seq(1)
     FROM    SYSTABLES
\end{verbatim}

The results are:

\begin{screen}
\begin{verbatim}
  seq(0, 100)
     100

  NAME                seq(1)
 SYSTABLES             100
 SYSCOLUMNS            101
 SYSINDEX              102
 SYSUSERS              103
 SYSPERMS              104
 SYSTRIG               105
 SYSMETAINDEX          106
\end{verbatim}
\end{screen}

% - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
\subsubsection{random}

Returns a random {\tt int}.  The syntax is:

\begin{verbatim}
	random(max [, seed])
\end{verbatim}

If {\tt seed} is given then the random number generator is seeded to
that value.  The random number generator will only be seeded once in
each session, and will be randomly seeded on the first call if no seed
is supplied.  The {\tt seed} parameter is ignored in the second and
later calls to {\tt random} in a process.

The returned number is always non-negative, and never larger than the
limit of the C lib's random number generator (typically either 32767
or 2147483647).  If {\tt max} is non-zero, then the returned number
will also be less than {\tt max}.

This function is typically used to either generate a random number for
later use, or to generate a random ordering of result records by adding
{\tt random} to the {\tt ORDER BY} clause.

Examples of typical use:

\begin{verbatim}
     SELECT  NAME, random(100)
     FROM    SYSTABLES
\end{verbatim}

The results might be:

\begin{screen}
\begin{verbatim}
  NAME                random(100)
 SYSTABLES               90
 SYSCOLUMNS              16
 SYSINDEX                94
 SYSUSERS                96
 SYSPERMS                 1
 SYSTRIG                 84
 SYSMETAINDEX            96
\end{verbatim}
\end{screen}

\begin{verbatim}
     SELECT  ENAME
     FROM    EMPLOYEE
     ORDER BY random(0);
\end{verbatim}

The results would be a list of employees in a random order.

\subsubsection{bintohex}
\label{bintohexSqlFunction}

  Converts a binary (\verb`varbyte`) value into a hexadecimal string.

\begin{verbatim}
    bintohex(varbyteData[, 'stream|pretty'])
\end{verbatim}

  A string (\verb`varchar`) hexadecimal representation of the
\verb`varbyteData` parameter is returned.  This can be useful to
visually examine binary data that may contain non-printable or nul
bytes.  The optional second argument is a comma-separated string of
any of the following flags:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb`stream`: Use the default output mode: a continuous
    stream of hexadecimal bytes, i.e. the same format that
    \verb`convert(varbyteData, 'varchar')` would have returned in
    Texis version 6 and earlier.

  \item \verb`pretty`: Return a ``pretty'' version of the data: print
    16 byte per line, space-separate the hexadecimal bytes, and print
    an ASCII dump on the right side.
\end{itemize}

The \verb`bintohex()` function was added in Texis version 7.  Caveat:
Note that in version 7 and later, \verb`convert()`ing data from/to
\verb`varbyte`/\verb`varchar` no longer converts the data to/from
hexadecimal by default (as was done in earlier versions) in programs
other than \verb`tsql`; it is now preserved as-is (though truncated at
nul for \verb`varchar`).  See the \verb`hexifybytes` SQL property
(p.~\pageref{hexifybytesProperty}) to change this.

\subsubsection{hextobin}

  Converts a hexadecimal stream to its binary representation.

\begin{verbatim}
    hextobin(hexString[, 'stream|pretty'])
\end{verbatim}

  The hexadecimal \verb`varchar` string \verb`hexString` is converted
to its binary representation, and the \verb`varbyte` result returned.
The optional second argument is a comma-separated string of any of the
following flags:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb`stream`: Only accept the \verb`stream` format of
    \verb`bintohex()`, i.e. a stream of hexadecimal bytes, the same
    format that \verb`convert(varbyteData, 'varchar')` would have
    returned in Texis version 6 and earlier.  Whitespace is
    acceptable, but only between (not within) hexadecimal bytes.
    Case-insensitive.  Non-conforming data will result in an error
    message and the function failing.

  \item \verb`pretty`: Accept either \verb`stream` or \verb`pretty`
    format data; if the latter, only the hexadecimal bytes are parsed
    (e.g. ASCII column is ignored).  Parsing is more liberal, but
    may be confused if the data deviates significantly from either
    format.
\end{itemize}

The \verb`hextobin()` function was added in Texis version 7.  Caveat:
Note that in version 7 and later, \verb`convert()`ing data from/to
\verb`varbyte`/\verb`varchar` no longer converts the data to/from
hexadecimal by default (as was done in earlier versions) in programs
other than \verb`tsql`; it is now preserved as-is (though truncated at
nul for \verb`varchar`).  See the \verb`hexifybytes` SQL property
(p.~\pageref{hexifybytesProperty}) to change this.

\subsubsection{identifylanguage}

  Tries to identify the predominant language of a given string.  By
  returning a probability in addition to the identified language, this
  function can also serve as a test of whether the given string is
  really natural-language text, or perhaps binary/encoded data
  instead.  Syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
    identifylanguage(text[, language[, samplesize]])
\end{verbatim}

  The return value is a two-element \verb`strlst`: a probability and a
  language code.  The probability is a value from {\tt 0.000} to
  {\tt 1.000} that the {\tt text} argument is composed in the
  language named by the returned language code.  The language code is
  a two-letter ISO-639-1 code.

  If an ISO-639-1 code is given for the optional {\tt language}
  argument, the probability for that particular language is returned,
  instead of for the highest-probability language of the
  known/built-in languages (currently {\tt de}, {\tt es}, {\tt fr},
  {\tt ja}, {\tt pl}, {\tt tr}, {\tt da}, {\tt en}, {\tt eu},
  {\tt it}, {\tt ko}, {\tt ru}).

  The optional third argument {\tt samplesize} is the initial integer
  size in bytes of the {\tt text} to sample when determining language;
  it defaults to 16384.  The {\tt samplesize} parameter was added in
  version 7.01.1382113000 20131018.

  Note that since a \verb`strlst` value is returned, the probability
  is returned as a \verb`strlst` element, not a \verb`double` value,
  and thus should be cast to \verb`double` during comparisons.  In
  Vortex with \verb`arrayconvert` on (the default), the return value
  will be automatically split into a two-element Vortex \verb`varchar`
  array.

  The \verb`identifylanguage()` function is experimental, and its
  behavior, syntax, name and/or existence are subject to change
  without notice.  Added in version 7.01.1381362000 20131009.

\subsubsection{lookup}
\label{lookup_SqlFunction}

By combining the \verb`lookup()` function with a \verb`GROUP BY`, a
column may be grouped into bins or ranges -- e.g. for price-range
grouping -- instead of distinct individual values.  Syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
    lookup(keys, ranges[, names])
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt keys} argument is one (or more, e.g. \verb`strlst`) values to
look up; each is searched for in the {\tt ranges} argument, which is
one (or more, e.g. \verb`strlst`) ranges.  All range(s) that the given
key(s) match will be returned.  If the {\tt names} argument is given,
the corresponding {\tt names} value(s) are returned instead; this
allows ranges to be renamed into human-readable values.  If {\tt
  names} is given, the number of its values must equal the number of
ranges.

Each range is a pair of values (lower and upper bounds) separated by
``{\tt ..}'' (two periods).  The range is optionally surrounded by
square (bound included) or curly (bound excluded) brackets.  E.g.:

\begin{verbatim}
[10..20}
\end{verbatim}

denotes the range 10 to 20: including 10 (``{\tt [}'') but not
  including (``{\tt \}}'') 20.  Both an upper and lower bracket must
  be given if either is present (though they need not be the same
  type).  The default if no brackets are given is to include the lower
  bound but exclude the upper bound; this makes consecutive ranges
  non-overlapping, if they have the same upper and lower bound and no
  brackets (e.g. ``0..10,10..20'').  Either bound may be omitted, in
  which case that bound is unlimited.  Each range's lower bound must
  not be greater than its upper bound, nor equal if either bound is
  exclusive.

If a {\tt ranges} value is not {\tt varchar}/{\tt char}, or does not
contain ``{\tt ..}'', its entire value is taken as a single inclusive
lower bound, and the exclusive upper bound will be the next {\tt
  ranges} value's lower bound (or unlimited if no next value).
E.g. the \verb`varint` lower-bound list:

\begin{verbatim}
0,10,20,30
\end{verbatim}

is equivalent to the \verb`strlst` range list:

\begin{verbatim}
[0..10},[10..20},[20..30},[30..]
\end{verbatim}

By using the \verb`lookup()` function in a \verb`GROUP BY`, a column may
be grouped into ranges.  For example, given a table {\tt Products}
with the following SKUs and \verb`float` prices:

\begin{verbatim}
    SKU    Price
    ------------
    1234   12.95
    1235    5.99
    1236   69.88
    1237   39.99
    1238   29.99
    1239   25.00
    1240   50.00
    1241   -2.00
    1242  499.95
    1243   19.95
    1244    9.99
    1245  125.00
\end{verbatim}

they may be grouped into price ranges (with most-products first) with
this SQL:

\begin{samepage}
{\small
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT   lookup(Price, convert('0..25,25..50,50..,', 'strlst', 'lastchar'),
     convert('Under $25,$25-49.99,$50 and up,', 'strlst', 'lastchar'))
       PriceRange, count(SKU) NumberOfProducts
FROM Products
GROUP BY lookup(Price, convert('0..25,25..50,50..,', 'strlst', 'lastchar'),
     convert('Under $25,$25-49.99,$50 and up,', 'strlst', 'lastchar'))
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
\end{verbatim}
}
\end{samepage}

or this Vortex:

\begin{samepage}
\begin{verbatim}
<$binValues =   "0..25"      "25..50"     "50..">
<$binDisplays = "Under $$25" "$$25-49.99" "$$50 and up">
<sql row "select lookup(Price, $binValues, $binDisplays) PriceRange,
              count(SKU) NumberOfProducts
          from Products
          group by lookup(Price, $binValues, $binDisplays)
          order by 2 desc">
  <fmt "%10s: %d\n" $PriceRange $NumberOfProducts>
</sql>
\end{verbatim}
\end{samepage}

which would give these results:

\begin{verbatim}
  PriceRange NumberOfProducts
------------+------------+
Under $25,              4
$50 and up,             4
$25-49.99,              3
                        1
\end{verbatim}

The trailing commas in {\tt PriceRange} values are due to them being
\verb`strlst` values, for possible multiple ranges.  Note the empty
{\tt PriceRange} for the fourth row: the -2 {\tt Price} matched
no ranges, and hence an empty {\tt PriceRange} was returned for
it.

\CAVEATS

The \verb`lookup()` function as described above was added in Texis
version 7.06.1528745000 20180611.

A different version of the \verb`lookup()` function was first added in
version 7.01.1386980000 20131213: it only took the second range syntax
variant (single lower bound); range values had to be in ascending
order (by {\tt keys} type); only the first matching range was
returned; and if a key did not match any range the first range was
returned.

\subsubsection{lookupCanonicalizeRanges}
\label{lookupCanonicalizeRanges_SqlFunction}

The \verb`lookupCanonicalizeRanges()` function returns the canonical
version(s) of its {\tt ranges} argument, which is zero or more ranges
of the syntaxes acceptable to \verb`lookup()`
(p.~\pageref{lookup_SqlFunction}):

\begin{verbatim}
    lookupCanonicalizeRanges(ranges, keyType)
\end{verbatim}

The canonical version always includes both a lower and upper
inclusive/exclusive bracket/brace, both lower and upper bounds (unless
unlimited), the ``{\tt ..}'' range operator, and is independent of
other ranges that may be in the sequence.

The {\tt keyType} parameter is a \verb`varchar` string denoting the
SQL type of the key field that would be looked up in the given
range(s).  This ensures that comparisons are done correctly.  E.g. for
a \verb`strlst` range list of ``{\tt 0,500,1000}'', {\tt keyType}
should be ``{\tt integer}'', so that ``{\tt 500}'' is not compared
alphabetically with ``{\tt 1000}'' and considered invalid (greater than).

This function can be used to verify the syntax of a range, or to
transform it into a standard form for \verb`lookupParseRange()`
(p.~\pageref{lookupParseRange_SqlFunction}).

\CAVEATS

For an implicit-upper-bound range, the upper bound is determined by
the {\em next} range's lower bound.  Thus the full list of ranges (if
multiple) should be given to \verb`lookupCanonicalizeRanges()` -- even
if only one range needs to be canonicalized -- so that each range gets
its proper bounds.

The \verb`lookupCanonicalizeRanges()` function was added in version
7.06.1528837000 20180612.  The {\tt keyType} parameter was added
in version 7.06.1535500000 20180828.

\subsubsection{lookupParseRange}
\label{lookupParseRange_SqlFunction}

The \verb`lookupParseRange()` function parses a single
\verb`lookup()`-style range into its constituent parts, returning them
as strings in one \verb`strlst` value.  This can be used by Vortex
scripts to edit a range.  Syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
    lookupParseRange(range, parts)
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt parts} argument is zero or more of the following part tokens
as strings:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb`lowerInclusivity`: Returns the inclusive/exclusive operator
    for the lower bound, e.g. ``{\tt \{}'' or ``{\tt [}''
  \item \verb`lowerBound`: Returns the lower bound
  \item \verb`rangeOperator`: Returns the range operator, e.g. ``{\tt ..}''
  \item \verb`upperBound`: Returns the upper bound
  \item \verb`upperInclusivity`: Returns the inclusive/exclusive operator
    for the upper bound, e.g. ``{\tt \}}'' or ``{\tt ]}''
\end{itemize}

If a requested part is not present, an empty string is returned for
that part.  The concatenation of the above listed parts, in the above
order, should equal the given range.  Non-string range arguments are
not supported.

The \verb`lookupParseRange()` function was added in
version 7.06.1528837000 20180612.

\EXAMPLE

\begin{verbatim}
    lookupParseRange('10..20', 'lowerInclusivity')
\end{verbatim}

would return a single empty-string \verb`strlst`, as there is no
lower-bound inclusive/exclusive operator in the range ``{\tt 10..20}''.

\begin{verbatim}
    lookupParseRange('10..20', 'lowerBound')
\end{verbatim}

would return a \verb`strlst` with the single value ``{\tt 10}''.

\CAVEATS

For an implicit-upper-bound range, the upper bound is determined by
the {\em next} range's lower bound.  Since \verb`lookupParseRange()`
only takes one range, passing such a range to it may result in an
incorrect (unlimited) upper bound.  Thus the full list of ranges (if
multiple) should always be given to \verb`lookupCanonicalizeRanges()`
first, and only then the desired canonicalized range passed to
\verb`lookupParseRange()`.

\subsubsection{hasFeature}

Returns 1 if given feature is supported, 0 if not (or unknown).
The syntax is:

\begin{verbatim}
	hasFeature(feature)
\end{verbatim}

where {\tt feature} is one of the following \verb`varchar` tokens:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \verb`RE2`  For RE2 regular expression support in REX
\end{itemize}

This function is typically used in Vortex scripts to test if a feature
is supported with the current version of Texis, and if not, to work
around that fact if possible.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
     <if hasFeature( "RE2" ) = 1>
       ... proceed with RE2 expressions ...
     <else>
       ... use REX instead ...
     </if>
\end{verbatim}

Note that in a Vortex script that does not support {\tt hasFeature()}
itself, such an \verb`<if>` statement will still compile and run,
but will be false (with an error message).

Added in version 7.06.1481662000 20161213.  Some feature tokens were
added in later versions.

\subsubsection{ifNull}

Substitute another value for NULL values.  Syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
   ifNull(testVal, replaceVal)
\end{verbatim}

  If \verb`testVal` is a SQL NULL value, then \verb`replaceVal` (cast
to the type of \verb`testVal`) is returned; otherwise \verb`testVal`
is returned.  This function can be used to ensure that NULL value(s)
in a column are replaced with a non-NULL value, if a non-NULL value
is required:

\begin{verbatim}
    SELECT ifNull(myColumn, 'Unknown') FROM myTable;
\end{verbatim}

Added in version 7.02.1405382000 20140714.  Note that SQL NULL is not
yet fully supported in Texis (including in tables).  See also
\verb`isNull`.

\subsubsection{isNull}

Tests a value, and returns a \verb`long` value of 1 if NULL, 0 if not.
Syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
   isNull(testVal)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
    SELECT isNull(myColumn) FROM myTable;
\end{verbatim}

Added in version 7.02.1405382000 20140714.  Note that SQL NULL is
not yet fully supported in Texis (including in tables).  Also note
that Texis \verb`isNull` behavior differs from some other SQL
implementations; see also \verb`ifNull`.

\subsubsection{xmlTreeQuickXPath}

Extracts information from an XML document.

\begin{verbatim}
	xmlTreeQuickXPath(string xmlRaw, string xpathQuery
        [, string[] xmlns)
\end{verbatim}

Parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb`xmlRaw` - the plain text of the xml document you want to
  extract information from
\item \verb`xpathQuery` - the XPath expression that identifies the
  nodes you want to extract the data from
\item \verb`xmlns` {\em(optional)} - an array of \verb`prefix=URI`
  namespaces to use in the XPath query
\end{itemize}

Returns:
\begin{itemize}
\item String values of the node from the XML document \verb`xmlRaw`
  that match \verb`xpathQuery`
\end{itemize}

\verb`xmlTreeQuickXPath` allows you to easily extract information from
an XML document in a one-shot function.  It is intended to be used in
SQL statements to extract specific information from a field that
contains XML data.

It is essentially a one statement version of the following:
\begin{verbatim}
    <$doc = (xmlTreeNewDocFromString($xmlRaw))>
    <$xpath = (xmlTreeNewXPath($doc))>
    <$nodes = (xmlTreeXPathExecute($xpathQuery))>
    <loop $nodes>
        <$ret = (xmlTreeGetAllContent($nodes))>
        <$content = $content $ret>
    </loop>
\end{verbatim}

\EXAMPLE
if the \verb`xmlData` field of a table has content like this:
\begin{verbatim}
<extraInfo>
    <price>8.99</price>
    <author>John Doe</author>
    <isbn>978-0-06-051280-4</isbn>
</extraInfo>
\end{verbatim}

Then the following SQL statement will match that row:
\begin{verbatim}
SELECT * from myTable where xmlTreeQuickXPath(data,
'/extraInfo/author') = 'John Doe'
\end{verbatim}

\section{Column Aliasing}

Similar to the abililty to alias the name of a table in the from clause
it is also possible to alias column names.  An alias can have up to 35
characters (case is significant).

This has several possible uses.
One is simply to produce a more informative report, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
    SELECT COUNT(*) EMPLOYEES
    FROM   EMPLOYEES;
\end{verbatim}

might produce the following output

\begin{screen}
\begin{verbatim}
    EMPLOYEES
       42
\end{verbatim}
\end{screen}

Another important use is when using the create table as select statement.
This allows you to rename a field, or to name a calculated field.

\begin{verbatim}
    CREATE TABLE INVENTORY AS
    SELECT PROD_ID, SALES * 3 MAX_LEVEL, SALES MIN_LEVEL
    FROM   SALES;
\end{verbatim}

Would create a new table with three fields, PROD\_ID, MAX\_LEVEL,
and MIN\_LEVEL.

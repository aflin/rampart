\subsection{Date functions}

The following date functions are available in Texis:
\verb`dayname`, \verb`month`, \verb`monthname`, \verb`dayofmonth`,
\verb`dayofweek`, \verb`dayofyear`, \verb`quarter`, \verb`week`,
\verb`year`, \verb`hour`, \verb`minute`, \verb`second`.

All the functions take a date as an argument.  \verb`dayname` and \verb`monthname` will return a string with the full day or month name based on the current
locale, and the others return a number.

The \verb`dayofweek` function returns 1 for Sunday.  The quarter is
based on months, so April 1st is the first day of quarter 2.  Week 1
begins with the first Sunday of the year.

Added in version: 3.0.948300000

The following functions were added in version 3.01.990400000:
\verb`monthseq`, \verb`weekseq` and \verb`dayseq` which will return the
number of months, weeks and days since an arbitrary past date.  These
can be used when comparing dates to see how many months, weeks or days
separate them.

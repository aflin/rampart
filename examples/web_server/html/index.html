    <p class="lead">Rampart is a javascript based complete stack development environment which is extremely resource stingy. This entire site is running on a Raspberry Pi Zero. Rampart is also fast and portable; it will run on nearly any *nix OS and benchmarks nearly as fast as Nginx on static content. It's also free to use, modify, and redistribute in most use cases.</p>

        <h2>HTTP, HTTPS, and Websockets</h2>
        <p>Rampart's HTTP/HTTPS server is based on a modded libevhtp and libevent2. Benchmarks showed that libevhtp outperformed Nginx (which we really respect), so that's why we chose it.  We haven't benchmarked it against Node yet but it's reasonable to assume we'll keep pace while consuming a lot less of the host's resources.</p>

        <p>LMDB is fast, truly ACID compliant key-value store. It's read biased and serves JSON objects really well. It's not as fast as Redis but then again, it'll never lose data when Redis might.</p><p><i>"LMDB is an extraordinarily fast, memory-efficient database developed for the OpenLDAP Project. With memory-mapped files, it has the read performance of a pure in-memory database while retaining the persistence of standard disk-based databases." -- Symas.com</i></p>

        <h2>Markdown Engine</h2>
        <p>The markdown engine uses the cmark library to implement the CommonMark syntax. This allows you to efficiently convert to HTML on the server side and have symmetry with the CommonMark client side javascript module. This is handy for things like blog entries, documentation, and CMS page markup.</p>

        <h2>CURL and ROBOTS.TXT</h2>
        <p>Rampart provides a robust interface to the curl library, giving you the ability to fetch URLs and post forms easily. The ROBOTS.TXT module uses Google's robots.txt code so you can avoid abusing sites that do not
        wish to have some content crawled.</p>

        <h2>More to come</h2>
        <p>We've been working on assembling Rampart for alpha release for over a year. Some stuff hasn't made it into it yet, but we are continuing to add features and by no means are we nearly done adding things. There's another really fast memory-mapped DB that was supposed to be in here (but I couldn't make the deadline). It should exceed Redis' and LMDB's speed while being a lot more memory efficient.  We've got a version of HyperLogLog that's substantially faster and more accurate than Google's or Redis' implementation. We'll have a non-crypto strength speedy hash and random number generation module soon too.</p>

    <h2 class="pb-2 border-top"> Why did we do this? </h2>
    <p>While NodeJS is extremely popular and NPM provides a ton of add-ons quickly, on the whole it's pretty fat. By the time you configure MariaDB and Apache Lucene you've eaten a day (or more) and a considerable amount of resources on the host machine. Additionally, it's not that much fun. </p>

    <p>In creating Rampart we sought to create a "full stack" that was simple and fast to download, configure, and start creating whatever application you had in mind in a time frame measured in minutes rather than days. User machines, phones, and IOT devices need to serve their primary role without impediment. Rampart's job is to support that role and not get in the way. OTOH if you dedicate a machine or cluster to a Rampart task
    you'll get a lot more done with a lot less investment.</p>

    <p>We chose the DukTape javascript engine over the V8 engine because while V8 is very fast, it's also kind of a RAM and CPU pig. Our philosophy was to do everything difficult or complex in C and let javascript be the fun-glue. That way it really didn't matter what engine was chosen. Almost every module is coded in C as is the DukTape interpreter. This makes everything extremely portable with a minimum amount of fuss. We include the Babel transpiler to drag DukTape into ECMAScript 2015+ land. Rampart checks at runtime if you've changed anything and then transpiles and byte-codes automatically behind the scenes.</p>

    <p>We hope you give this thing a try. Talk to us in the Message Board if you have any problems, find bugs, or need help.</p> 

    <h2 class="pb-2 border-top"> Who are we? </h2> 
    <p> Moat Crossing Systems LLC, the makers of Rampart, is a couple of guys who between them have developed software and applications that have served many billions of pages of database backed content on the internet. We had some summer help from a couple of Columbia students who helped up keep tabs on the "current-think" and coded some of the OS Utility functions. It all started in January of 2020 with a phone conversation where we were bitching about how un-fun web development had become, and how resource heavy everything seemed to be. A comment was made that if we could full-text index Wikipedia and serve it up on a Raspberry Pi Zero, then we'd have something unique that people might want. So that's what we did.</p>

<h2>How is Texis different from other search engines?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-is-texis-different-from-other-search-engines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Texis is the only search engine with the structure of a SQL relational
database (rdbms). SQL as used here means Structured Query Language – not
Microsoft’s product named with that term! SQL is an industry standard
defined by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and its
counterpart, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
All major database vendors use SQL as their query language.</p>
<p>SQL provides many advantages for addressing complicated search
requirements. It also provides you with the confidence of a reliable,
well-defined path for implementing unanticipated new search
functionality in the future. SQL is a rich, mature, open standard used
by hundreds of thousands of database application developers around the
world.</p>
<p>All other search engines provide a much narrower range of capabilities
based on proprietary interfaces. No other search engine provides the
versatility of using SQL as its application development model.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-is-texis-different-from-other-relational-databases">
<h2>How is Texis different from other relational databases?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-is-texis-different-from-other-relational-databases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Texis is the only relational database that can store and search text
documents of unlimited size within standard database tables. All other
solutions that purport to accomplish this employ, either explicitly or
“under the covers,” a loosely coupled external text index, and store
documents in a binary large object (blob) field. That approach causes
major bottlenecks.</p>

<div class="section" id="whats-so-hard-about-integrating-text-search-with-an-rdmbs">
<h2>What’s so hard about integrating text-search with an RDMBS?<a class="headerlink" href="#whats-so-hard-about-integrating-text-search-with-an-rdmbs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Text-searching and relational database management are radically
different paradigms for organizing and retrieving information. They were
developed over decades as completely separate technologies and do not
marry easily. Thunderstone has devoted more than 10 years to solving
this problem; it is our “core competency.” Thunderstone is the only
software vendor to have undertaken and solved this challenge head-on.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-texis-a-content-management-system">
<h2>Is Texis a content management system?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-texis-a-content-management-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many of our customers use Texis for content management. Examples include
legal document archiving and editorial publishing systems. However,
Texis “out of the box” is not a finished content management application.
You must customize it for that purpose – see below regarding application
development. One of the benefits of using Texis for content management
is that you can make it do what you want. If off-the-shelf content
management solutions don’t quite do everything you need, you’ll end up
bringing in consultants (programmers) to customize it anyway. Sometimes
it is preferable to start with a more generic platform, and design
exactly what you need from the start.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-texis-an-e-commerce-system">
<h2>Is Texis an e-commerce system?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-texis-an-e-commerce-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many e-commerce web sites use Texis. Some are powered entirely by Texis
technology. Others use Texis as a search engine, together with commerce
tools of other vendors. Texis is an ideal application development
platform for various e-commerce applications. Thunderstone also provides
some generic commerce application scripts that may be customized with
the tools discussed below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="is-texis-a-portal-system">
<h2>Is Texis a portal system?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-texis-a-portal-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The word “portal” has come to mean a uniform web “front-end” to
disparate “back-end” computer systems. Texis includes many
portal-building features. The most important relate to web fetching,
i.e., retrieving content from other web applications in real-time. A
typical use of this ability is to create a “federated” search
application that integrates results from disparate sources. Texis
actually is a whole suite of tools that together enable a developer to
create, deploy, and maintain web-based applications. The tool suite
encompasses: a scripting environment; data importing utilities, a web
crawler; a database; a search engine; and even a web server.</p>

<div class="section" id="is-texis-a-knowledge-management-km-system">
<h2>Is Texis a knowledge management (KM) system?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-texis-a-knowledge-management-km-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Knowledge Management is a broad term for sharing of knowledge within an
organization systematically, instead of informally as is the human
tradition. Tools for searching archives are fundamental to KM. In many
cases, an effective internal search engine will give you the greatest KM
benefit for the least investment. Texis is designed to meet the most
sophisticated internal search needs. The idea of KM may encompass a
variety of other applications such as cataloging of individuals’
expertise. Texis provides tools for creating such applications, but they
are not “out of the box” features.</p>

<p>Search engine Z uses only a subset of the SQL language, and does not
perform some of the basic functions of a database. For example, it
probably doesn’t support JOIN operations, the DISTINCT argument, the
GROUP BY command, the HAVING clause. These are all generic features of
the SQL language. And when records are updated (changed), it must
rebuild the search index in a time-consuming batch operation. In between
index rebuilds – which may occur only once a day – searches match the
old stale data, not the new data. A true relational database (of which
Texis is one) never allows the indexes to get “out of sync” with the
data.</p>

<p>Texis is the core technology, encompassing the database and search
engine capabilities.</p>
<p>Texis Web Script also is known as Vortex. This is an application
development (scripting) tool set. It is bundled with Texis. Texis Web
Script is a superset of HTML, with extensions for passing calls to the
Texis database. Returned data is dynamically marked up, normally with
HTML but optionally with JavaScript or any other markup language. Texis
applications may alternately be created with a variety of other
technologies.</p>
<p>Webinator is an application of Texis. The Webinator crawler (dowalk)
extracts the content of web pages and stores each as a record in a Texis
database. The database thus becomes a search engine for the spidered
pages. It can be queried through normal Texis SQL SELECT… LIKE
statements, but a generic web interface also is provided. Webinator is
given out as an example Texis application, but under conditions defined
by its acceptable-use policy (see license addendum), it may be used for
indexing a web site(s) without purchasing a full Texis license.</p>
<p>The Search Appliance also is based on Texis. It encompasses the features
of Webinator, with some additional capabilities such as the ability to
crawl file systems and respect document permission settings. The
Appliance is created to be a “turn-key” solution, so that the customer
does not need to install or configure software or operating system
features. The Search Appliance is designed to be administered by a
business user, as opposed to a technical user.</p>

<h2>What is the “target market” for Texis?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-the-target-market-for-texis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Target applications include online publishing, interactive catalogs,
classified advertising, digital asset management, intelligence, and of
course, web searching. What these all have in common is that they
require both structured and unstructured types of searching. For
example, product catalogs typically contain unstructured text (name,
description, etc.), as well as structured content (size, price,
inventory number, etc.). Users may wish to search by description; or
navigate by price range; or both in combination. Texis is the premier
solution for providing text searching tightly integrated with
traditional structured database querying.</p>

<h2>How are search-engine type queries expressed in SQL?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-search-engine-type-queries-expressed-in-sql" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In Texis, full-text search terms go inside the LIKE clause. An expanded
syntax, including the familiar + and - operators, is supported. This
expanded syntax by necessity is implemented as an extension of SQL
simply because traditional search-engine type queries are not defined in
standard SQL.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-a-metamorph-index">
<h2>What is a Metamorph index?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-metamorph-index" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is Thunderstone’s name for an inverted (search-engine) index on a
column of unstructured text, as distinguished from a b-tree
(sorted-order) index normally used on numeric or string database fields.
This following is somewhat technical and is intended for experienced
database programmers.</p>
<p>A Metamorph index is set up and used in a manner analogous to any other
database index:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">create</span> <span class="n">metamorph</span> <span class="n">index</span> <span class="n">descriptionindex</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">products</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">description</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As an illustration of the power this provides, consider a typical Texis
query of this model:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SELECT</span> <span class="nb">id</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">name</span> <span class="n">FROM</span> <span class="n">products</span> <span class="n">WHERE</span> <span class="n">description</span> <span class="n">LIKE</span> <span class="s1">&#39;big fancy gizmo&#39;</span>
   <span class="n">ORDER</span> <span class="n">BY</span> <span class="n">price</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The Texis database optimizer uses the metamorph index on the description
field, along with the B-tree index on the price field, to quickly and
efficiently resolve this query. (From a more technical point of view,
you’d probably create a single compound index combining the
characteristics of those two indexes, for even better performance.)</p>
<p>Any other database, to accomplish something similar, would receive no
help from the database optimizer. The text index is a black box to it.
It can only hand off the gizmo query to a separate text index; then
create a temporary table containing the text-search results; then do a
join between that and the table containing the price information.</p>
<p>Texis is the only relational database that can resolve a query of this
type without a join. This makes Texis many times more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="are-documents-stored-within-texis-or-as-separate-files">
<h2>Are documents stored within Texis, or as separate files?<a class="headerlink" href="#are-documents-stored-within-texis-or-as-separate-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Either! It depends on the circumstances. Web-searching is a typical
example of indexing external documents: the Texis crawler extracts
information about the pages and builds an index (database) based on
that; search results consist of links to those pages. On the other hand,
in an auction application, the original information typically exists
entirely within the database: users input their listings directly into
the database; and search results consist of links to records within the
database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-i-need-a-texis-dba-database-administrator">
<h2>Do I need a Texis DBA (database administrator)?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-i-need-a-texis-dba-database-administrator" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Probably not. Administering a Texis database is simpler than
administering other databases such as Oracle. Texis runs as an
application on top of the operating system and does not usurp operating
system functions. So backing up a Texis database, for example, can be
accomplished simply by copying a directory (but see below regarding
redundancy). Texis does have various administrative aspects and
configuration options, but overseeing those usually is handled by the
application developer(s).</p>

<h2>Can Texis handle BLOBs (binary large objects)?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-texis-handle-blobs-binary-large-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes. Texis has a blob-type field useful for storing graphics or other
binary data. But note that in Texis, textual content of any size usually
is put in a variable-size varchar field. This provides superior
text-indexing and searching functionality compared to storing text into
blobs. But if you have binary content, Texis can manage the storage of
files much more efficiently than an OS file system! That is because
Texis keeps track of each record’s location on disk, and can fetch it
with a single disk seek-and-read operation; whereas operating systems
are un-indexed, so that fetching files typically takes four or more
seek-and-reads to search through the directory structure.</p>

<div class="section" id="does-texis-do-data-mining">
<h2>Does Texis do data mining?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-texis-do-data-mining" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, definitely. The idea of data mining carries the connotation of a
large archive of data collected from other business processes. The
archive is used for analysis, typically in a search for trends or
relationships not obvious in the normal course of business. Texis is an
excellent platform for data mining and may be superior to traditional
databases for this purpose, depending on the kind of data and analyses
needed. Texis is most versatile for querying data that combines
structured and unstructured elements. Many business databases containing
unstructured text fields, such as customer correspondence or support
logs. Insights may be found in patterns either in the structured or
unstructured data, or in a combination. Texis is the market’s leading
tool for such research.</p>

<h2>Does Texis support Boolean logic?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-texis-support-boolean-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes. Full Boolean logic is standard within the SQL language. Texis also
understands the + and - operators popularized by web search engines. And
Texis understands set logic, which can be used to express a command of
the style “Find records containing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> or more words of my query.”
Absent explicit operators, the default logic is specified by the
application developer.</p>

<div class="section" id="does-texis-have-fuzzy-logic">
<h2>Does Texis have fuzzy logic?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-texis-have-fuzzy-logic" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes. The Texis facility for accomplishing this is called approximate
pattern matching. This generates a similarity measure between any two
words or patterns, expressed as a percentage of closeness. The user or
application developer may control the degree of closeness. This
capability most commonly is desired to accommodate spelling mistakes in
either the queries or the data. It can be useful in searching scanned
documents, which tend to have errors resulting from the imperfect OCR
process. Developers should use this feature with caution, however. Fuzzy
logic, by its nature, brings back some records unrelated to the either
the user’s query words or the intended meaning. This tends to confuse
and annoy users not expecting this style of response.</p>

<p>Yes. Texis’s sorting power is one of its most popular features. You may
sort the results of a text search by any field in your data. For
example, if your database contains an author field, you can sort search
results by author. This works efficiently even on large result sets, by
taking advantage of the powerful sorting capability inherent within
relational database technology. Texis can quickly sort tens of thousands
of hits or more. Other search engines either bog down sorting more than
a few hundred items, or else their sorting capabilities are much more
limited. For example, one major search engine cannot perform
relevance-ranking together with sorting; another can sort by date only,
not by other fields.</p>

<h2>Can Texis organize results by category?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-texis-organize-results-by-category" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes. This is another powerful feature benefiting from relational
technology. You’re not limited to presenting results in one long list.

the results grouped by state. Categories also may be a hierarchical
structure, Yahoo-style.</p>

<p>Elementary! What some people call zones, are in database lingo, fields.
With Texis you may query any field separately or in combination with
other fields. And queries are not limited to text! If one field (zone)
contains a postal code, for example, you could query that with a numeric
range such as 90011 through 97000.</p>

<p>Texis contains a sophisticated ranking system that may be tuned in
various ways. Factors it uses include: closeness of query words to the
beginning of a document; order of occurrence of the query words; and
proximity (closeness) of query words to each other within a record.
These factors may be weighted to change the ranking behavior. As an
example of how that might be useful: newspaper articles tend to have the
most important material close to the beginning, so in a newspaper search
application, you might give that factor more weight.</p>

<p>Yes, but note that “personalization” is used to describe many kinds of
functionality. At the simplest level, you may store user preferences, so
that each user receives only desired information when visiting the site.
To accomplish this, Texis can recognize users by login or cookie, and it
provides a mechanism for carrying a user’s identity from page to page in
an encrypted format, so that preferences may be taken into account on
every page visited. Personalization sometimes refers to a more elaborate

however, that other search engines may or may not allow meta-searching.</p>
<p>If you seek to spider the entire web and build a proprietary web-search

the USA, this type of application may be especially important for
compliance with laws mandating that significant business data be saved
and kept available for auditing. Indexing email archives can also be an
important management role. Texis goes far beyond most email archiving
solutions that only allow one to search by header such as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">From</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">To</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Date</span></code> fields. Texis will index the full text of both
messages and attachments. It will allow sophisticated queries such as a
phrase in attachment, between two dates, with results grouped by author.</p>

<h2>Can Texis classify documents into categories?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-texis-classify-documents-into-categories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes. In the simplest case, this depends on how well you can define the
categories. If you can specify a query or set of words describing each
category, it is quite straightforward. Assigning a category does not
need to be a yes-or-no operation; multiple categories may be assigned
with a strength (relevance) rating. In many cases that we see, the
source or author of a document, or other metadata, plays a significant
part in the rules determining category assignments.</p>
<p>In other situations, the rules for assigning categories are not so clear
cut. Categories may have been assigned in the past by humans who simply
“know one when they see it.” For these needs, the Texis Categorizer is
available as an add-on module. The Categorizer “learns” to reproduce
these decisions from past the category assignments. It assigns the most
likely categories, each with a relevance score. New categories may be
created by administrators on an ad-hoc basis.</p>

providing it to, an affiliate site. On output, Texis can apply XML
markup dynamically even if the data is stored without XML tags. On
input, XML data typically would be parsed into fields; but XML mark-up
can be preserved in the database if necessary. Texis Web Script contains
facilities for full manipulation of XML data. Webinator (a product built

<h2>What hardware resources does Texis need?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-hardware-resources-does-texis-need" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Resource requirements depend on the database structure, record count,
record sizes, query complexity, and of course any other functionality
handled at the application (script) layer. As a benchmark, a Texis
database containing one million records of typical web page content can
serve typical web-search queries at a sustained rate of at least 10 per
second on a single-CPU Unix server with 1GB RAM. The biggest single
variable affecting performance is usually RAM, which will be used for
index caching. Disk space needs are approximately the ASCII text size of
the content plus 20 percent for basic full-text indexes. The space
needed for indexes could be up to several times more for applications
requiring additional or more detailed indexes.</p>

Microsoft as a generic interface to any relational database.
Unfortunately, the specification has considerable “overhead” that tends

<p>Yes, Texis is used in many languages. It probably will work
automatically for most European languages. Support for UTF-8 (Unicode)

be preserved in the data and become fully searchable, if desired. There
are settings to control how searches respond to case, diacritical marks
(accents etc.), ligatures, character width etc. For example, searches
may be configured to ignore accents, so that users unable to enter
accented characters may still find accented-character data, and

setting tells Texis to index multi-byte patterns (if other than UTF-8).
Our customers report satisfactory results with this approach. However,
there are some options to improve the accuracy. For example, a specific
character in Chinese may sometimes be a word on its own, and other times
part of a different word. Chinese readers discern the difference from
the context, but there is no indication in the text as to which it is.

<p>Stemming refers to a process of stripping a word down to its root by
removing suffixes or prefixes (such as the “s” on the end of English
plurals), and then searching for valid variations of the root (known as
morphemes). Texis provides very sophisticated morpheme processing, with
default rules that apply to English. Various aspects of morpheme
processing may be turned on or off, and the rules customized. A set of
morpheme processing rules may be specified for any language. However, we

rules for most other languages. A user organization typically will wish
to customize these rules not only for your language, but for a

<h2>Must Texis customers display a Thunderstone emblem on their sites?<a class="headerlink" href="#must-texis-customers-display-a-thunderstone-emblem-on-their-sites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>No. Texis customers may totally customize the look-and-feel of their
applications, and a Thunderstone acknowledgement in the HTML content is
not required. However, Webinator users must display a Thunderstone
copyright and logo.</p>

<h2>Does Thunderstone have a VAR (value-added-reseller) program?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-thunderstone-have-a-var-value-added-reseller-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Yes, we encourage VAR relationships. The key aspect is in the “value
added.” We expect our VARs to add value by developing applications on
top of Texis for third-party clients. Please contact us for more
information on becoming a VAR.</p>

<div class="section" id="will-thunderstone-develop-an-application-or-solution-to-my-specifications">
<h2>Will Thunderstone develop an application or solution to my specifications?<a class="headerlink" href="#will-thunderstone-develop-an-application-or-solution-to-my-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maybe. We do have a consulting arm that undertakes such efforts. The
requirements need to be well developed before we can bid on a project. A
good way to define the requirements is to mock up the entire application
in static HTML pages. We are not graphic designers and do not create the
look-and-feel. But we can incorporate a design scheme defined by others.</p>

<div class="section" id="can-thunderstone-recommend-any-third-party-texis-consultants">
<h2>Can Thunderstone recommend any third-party Texis consultants?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-thunderstone-recommend-any-third-party-texis-consultants" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Maybe. There actually is some misunderstanding about what skills Texis
consulting entails. The relevant experience is mostly related to
standard rdbms application development and web scripting. Very little of
it is Texis-specific. Thus, the best consultant may be a local database
application developer who can sit down with you to understand your
project. Ideally, a consultant will have implemented a web front-end to
a large SQL database, such as one involving a million-row table. With
that in mind, however, please let us know your needs. We might be able
to refer you to a consultant or VAR for a custom solution to a specific
problem.</p>

<h2>Is Thunderstone stock publicly traded? What are Thunderstone’s annual revenues?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-thunderstone-stock-publicly-traded-what-are-thunderstones-annual-revenues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Thunderstone is privately held and does not disclose internal financial
information. But we can tell you that we are a 30-year-old company that
is conservatively managed and has never required venture capital. We do
not subscribe to the philosophy of trying to build market share by
spending millions of dollars more on promotion than comes in as revenue.
We have grown based on re-invested profits, and we stay away from
“bet-your-company” strategies!</p>

<div class="section" id="what-fallback-do-i-have-if-thunderstone-ever-goes-out-of-business-or-discontinues-supporting-texis">
<h2>What fallback do I have if Thunderstone ever goes out of business or discontinues supporting Texis?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-fallback-do-i-have-if-thunderstone-ever-goes-out-of-business-or-discontinues-supporting-texis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Texis is a mature and stable product that has been on the market for 17
years. At most customer sites, Texis runs for many months without
restarting. However, we recognize that many customers are wary of
becoming overly reliant on any one software vendor. The ultimate
fallback, should a customer ever need to discontinue using Texis, lies
precisely in Thunderstone’s adherence to standards. Texis data may
easily be transferred into any competitive SQL database. Likewise, Texis
scripts consist essentially of standard HTML with encapsulated SQL calls
that could, with some effort but not an unreasonable amount, be
converted to a competitive scripting environment. Of course, other
databases at this time do not come close to Texis’s performance in
text-intensive applications. However, if that situation changes in the
future, the migration path to an alternate solution would be
straightforward.</p>

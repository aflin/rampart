Tsql Command Line Utility
=========================
::

    tsql [-a command] [-c [-w width]] [-l rows] [-hqm?] [-d database]
    [-u username] [-p password] [-i file] ["SQL statement"]

Tsql is the main program provided for interactive use of a Texis
database. You should either be in the database directory, or else
specify it on the command line as the -d <database> option.

If a query is present on the command line than tsql will execute that
statement, and display the results on stdout (the screen). If no query
is present then queries will be accepted on stdin (the keyboard).
Queries on stdin must be terminated by a semicolon. To exit from tsql
you should produce EOF on itâ€™s stdin. On Unix systems this is usually
done with Control-D (a Control-C should also exit the program).

Tsql also provides facilities for doing many administrative tasks.

**Options**

To aid in the use of tsql from scripts or as parts of a chain of
commands there are many options available, which may be viewed by
executing ``tsql -help`` or ``tsql -?`` on the command line:
